## [1.2.0] — 2026-03-19

### Added

- **Modal keyboard accessibility** — Modal closes on Escape key.
- **RuleCard keyboard support** — Entire card is keyboard-activatable (Enter/Space) and clickable to edit; `role="button"`, `tabIndex={0}`, `aria-label` for screen readers.
- **RuleEditor resizable layout** — Draggable split pane between form and response panels with minimum 300px width.
- **Variable conditions JSON view** — Toggle between list and JSON editing for variable conditions; validation via `parseConditionsJson`.

### Changed

- **Modal** — Escape key handler with proper event listener cleanup.
- **RuleCard** — Card-level click opens editor; `stopPropagation` on action buttons so toggle/duplicate don't trigger card click.
- **RuleEditor** — `expandConditionsForDisplay` and `collapseValueForStorage` for readable JSON editing; resizable layout state management.
- **Options CSS** — New styles for resizable panels, split layout, JSON editor view.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-17

### Added

- **cURL Import** — import rules directly from cURL commands via a new modal in the options page; automatically parses endpoint, headers, and body to pre-fill a new rule.
- **Tooltip component** — reusable tooltip UI for inline field hints across the options page.
- **Modal component** — generic modal wrapper used by the cURL import flow.
- **ConfirmPopover component** — inline confirmation popover for destructive actions (e.g., rule deletion).
- **CodeEditor component** — Monaco-based code editor component for response body editing with JSON syntax highlighting.
- **Theme CSS** — shared CSS variables and theme utilities extracted into `src/shared/theme.css` for consistent styling.
- **parseCurl utility** — robust cURL command parser (`src/shared/parseCurl.ts`) supporting `-H`, `-d`, `--data`, `--url`, and method flags.
- **148 new unit tests** — full coverage for the `parseCurl` utility.

### Changed

- **UI Enhancements** — refreshed options page layout: improved sidebar navigation, cleaner RuleCard design, and updated RuleEditor field arrangement.
- **Popup CSS** — simplified popup styles, reduced bundle size.
- **Options CSS** — extended theming, added new component styles (tooltips, modals, popovers, code editor wrapper).
- **webpack.config.js** — added Monaco Editor webpack plugin and copy rules for the new theme CSS.
- **package.json** — added `@monaco-editor/react`, updated dev dependencies.

### Technical

- Switched to `pnpm` for dependency management (lockfile added).
- Injected interceptor (`intercept.js`) remains vanilla JS — no build-time changes.

## [1.0.0] — 2025-02-19

### Added

- **Core interception engine** — intercepts `fetch()` and `XMLHttpRequest` GraphQL requests at the page level.
- **Rule management** — full CRUD for mock rules via the options page.
- **Matching engine** — matches requests by endpoint pattern, operation name (exact or regex), query body regex, and variable conditions.
- **Variable conditions** — 7 operators: equals, not_equals, contains, regex, exists, not_exists, json_path.
- **Batched request support** — matches individual operations within a single batched GraphQL request.
- **Priority system** — when multiple rules match, the highest-priority rule wins.
- **Response delay** — configurable delay per rule to simulate slow responses.
- **Rule groups** — organize rules into named groups, toggle groups on/off.
- **Import / Export** — share rule configurations as JSON files.
- **Popup** — quick toggle, active rule count, interception counter, link to options.
- **Dark themed UI** — popup and options page with a dark color scheme.
- **Sample rules** — included in `examples/sample-rules.json` for quick onboarding.
- **40 unit tests** — covering the entire matching engine.

### Technical

- Chrome Extension Manifest V3.
- TypeScript 5.3, React 18, Webpack 5, Jest 29.
- Service worker architecture (background) with content script bridge.
- Injected interceptor runs in page context (vanilla JS, no module imports).
